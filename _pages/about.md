I am a PhD student under the supervision of Pr. Yannick Est√®ve and Dr. Valentin Vielzeuf. I work between [Orange Labs](https://www.orange.com/) and the Speech and Language Team of [LIA](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/).
My work lies at the intersection of ***Artificial Intelligence*** and ***Linguistics***. My research focuses on ***Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)*** in the context of ***Task-Oriented Dialogues (TOD)***.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
