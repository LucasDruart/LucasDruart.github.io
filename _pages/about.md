I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Pr. Yannick Est√®ve](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dQDAeBYAAAAJ&hl) and [Dr. Valentin Vielzeuf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=ve7hYuQAAAAJ). I work between [Orange Labs](https://www.orange.com/) and the Speech and Language Team of [LIA](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/). My research focuses on ***Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)*** in the context of ***Task-Oriented Dialogues (TOD)***.

More broadly I am interested in understanding how we can use Artificial Neural Networks to help us understand, organize and analyze large quantities of data.   

On my spare time I enjoy getting new perspectives by reading books or watching movies, cooking nice meals and hiking.
